# Active-Learning-Implementations

This was part of a group assignment for the course Machine Learning in BITS Pilani to implement various Active learning methods 
For testing, we have used the wine dataset within sklearn. 

The following Algorithms have been implemented in both stream-based and pool-based approaches:-
Uncertainty Sampling - Least Confident, Margin, Entropy
Query by Committee - Entropy, KL Divergence
Diversity Sampling

We have also implemented a Kmeans based Active learning method also
